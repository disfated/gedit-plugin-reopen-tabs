# Reopen tabs plugin for Gedit

Saves opened tabs on exit and restores them on next gedit starup.

Forked from Eugene Khorev's @ <http://code.google.com/p/reopen-tabs-gedit-plugin/> and fixes some [issues](http://code.google.com/p/reopen-tabs-gedit-plugin/issues/list).

 - Restores tabs even when gedit was killed. Need testing - please report bugs.

 - Restores only existing files.

 - Doesn't have preferences - when enabled always saves current session. To close gedit without saving current session just hit `Ctrl+Q` or `File` - `Exit`.
