# reopen-tabs plugin for Gedit

Saves opened tabs on exit and restores them on next gedit starup.

Forked from Eugene Khorev's @ <http://code.google.com/p/reopen-tabs-gedit-plugin/>

 - Restores tabs even when gedit was killed.

 - To close gedit without saving current session just hit `Ctrl+Q` or `File` - `Exit`.
